It is possible that she says no because she is scared. \n2. Then you may say her that you can ask any question to mommy. Mom will not scold her. Even if you did in the past, it will not repeat. This way, your daughter will have one person to whom she can ask questions. \n3. Check the school once whether they allow students to ask questions or not."

What can I do",

But 90% is gone because she knows that if she doesn‚Äôt get ready and her school has a cut off time of 8.45am. And if she doesn‚Äôt get school on time, she will have to spend a day at home when all her friends will be at school. So actually, there is sense of agency. And this is what we need to activate in every child. Their own sense of agency to do things. We can‚Äôt keep pushing them. Then the sense of agency goes away. So you need to take a step back and let the child be responsible."

You could explore them as well.\n\nWhen the same kid becomes 14-15 years old, stop listening to his parents and only does what his friends do. So parents tell him you only do what your friends are telling. Can‚Äôt you think for your ownself.\n\nAnd now when your child is younger. when he is different and we think why is he different and not like other kids.

   "prompt": "I hav found that u understand d subconscious mind of d child .\nI hav a request pls can u tell when to start preschool or play school for kids - i mean what age n everyone tells it's normal if they cry for first few days .\nI want to kno how does psychology works of a child ....\nI couldn't see my child crying her heart out bcoz she dint wanted to go n everyone told me I'm over pampering her n let her cry ....\nIt will b gr8 if u could spare some time n answer my query",
   "completion": "Vishakha ji, kids cry for a lot of reasons.- first few days, they can have separation anxiety. If you have it when you go to drop her, she will sense it. So imp for you to be calm- say you are leaving from your house for school and she says mumma i dont want to go, starts to cry a bit and to keep her calm you say we are not going to school but then you do go to school, she starts crying again. So our lying is contributing to her crying. We should 100% stop lying.It is imp to see that the school has the right environment for the child. That means - place to play, free play, to run around, loving teachers. A good play school can help a child make friends and be comfortable in the company of others apart from parents.What is most imp for your child to know is that you are there for her. And that you will come back to pick her. Once she feels secure she will be ok"

I am glad that it showed up!üòÉ because I really like the way you are sharing your thoughts, analysis of child behavior patterns and also sharing important parenting tips in detail which are much needed for this gen working parents. I'm conciosuly trying my best to inclucate Montenssori method of teaching and raising a chid with gentle and respectful parenting. Din't know how simple and effetive these methods are in raising an independent and empathetic generation. Though very exhausting compared to traditional parenting method we were brought up with, it's very rewarding as it's scientific and extremely respectful way of treating another individual. Thank you soo much ‚ù§Ô∏èfor making time to share your knowledge on this platform to help us new gen parents stay more educated on these topics! üòáon a side note, I keep getting asked questions many times by my family and friends to justify the parenting style I'm trying to follow and insisting them also to practice, and without thorough research and understanding myself I feel it hard to be convinced to implement any practice.one such is kid hitting and I have understood how yelling or scolding the child for hitting doesn't help in their growth and informing them that it's hurting others, giving them options to use their hands for other activities than hitting, taking them to safe space , giving them time to calm down etc.. slowly has actually helped in making my child to hit less.. but the question I got back is \" how do you handle when your child gets hit by some other child at school? how will you prevent it? by making him all empathetic and gentle won't he be too sensitive? shoudl he not hit back if someone is bullying him or hitting him?\" can you please help me in getting answers to these. I've tried searching but not got any solid answers yet. If you already have reels on this, can you please share it or any other links anytime you are free .. it'd be very helpful ! üòá",

It‚Äôs feels very honest and not off the mill type of parenting tips we are seeing all over the Internet.I‚Äôm going through a tough time in my life. I will be divorcing my covert narcissistic husband of 11 years. I‚Äôm at loss at how I will handle my soon to be 7 year old daughter. How I will break the news to her.?How I will answer her qs ?She is too young to understand in what way her father is not good for us and I don‚Äôt want to burden her with things which are beyond her understanding.She has a very strong sense of what a family should be like even though I have a strong support system from my parents.The normal rule of thumb that one should never speak bad about your ex husband / both parents should sit down and talk with your child about the divorce usually doesn‚Äôt work in cases when one parent is toxic and doesn‚Äôt seem quite interested in being in the child‚Äôs life other than for the sole reason of social image.I know you haven‚Äôt covered parenting in abnormal situations in your blog yet. But maybe in your research if you can find any solution, it will be of great help to me.I have been reading books, messaging therapists. But haven‚Äôt find any solution yet.Thanks for reading through such a long msg. So far I have thought of telling her that her father will be staying at her grandparents house to take care of them bcz they are old and a bit sick.But it‚Äôs a lie. And maybe it‚Äôs a type of gaslighting ( to which I had been subjected to for 11 years ) which I don‚Äôt want to do to my child.

(or you can give a simple reason here)You can still meet him when you like. And I will always be here for youKids can sense anxiety. So the key part for you is to be comfortable with your own decision. When she sees her mother comfortable, it could be easier for herAnother thing you could do is educate her about different types of families in the world. 2 girls raising a kid, 2 boys, you can see Modern Family show where 2 fathers are raising a kid.But lead from there. Her concerns might just be simple ones of self preservation. So listen and simply answer. I hope this helps"

   "completion": "Hi Romayne - \n\nThank you for writing. One good information to have would have been - has there been any change of routine for your child?\n\nBut here are a few reasons I can think of.\nsometimes girl children get UTI which makes it difficult to control pee\nor there is pain happening while peeing so they control it till they no longer can\nyou could get it checked with a doctor\n\nsecond could be that the reason is emotional which is high probability coz she says she is scared. The reason this happens is generally if there has been a change in routine. Like you have started going to work or she saw a movie which was scary or if she has been ill or someone close has been ill, there is a new school or nanny.\n\nThe key part is this: being potty trained is not about making a mess or not. It is a way for a child to feel confident that this is my body, I can control it. So what is imp is that you or noone else makes her feel that there is a problem. \n\nLike 'Arey beta, why are you doing this, you were potty trained, then now why this'. This means you are pointing a fault in her. \n\nIf incident happens you can just calmly help her. And for the things she is scared you can go with her. If the reason is emotional then as she becomes more comfortable with the new order it will go away on its own once she gets used to the new routine"

And sometimes others don‚Äôt want to play, right. He nodsHow does that make you feelAngryI understandI understand you want to play so badly. But we will not use our hands and feetWe will not use our hands and feet. Anothe replace to do this conversation is just before he is going to play with his friends.

Should we really give her whatever she is asking. Because in last two weeks she has stolen few things from her peers. Which she hid from me and kept in her cupboard.

If we shout at the child the next time the child may be just won‚Äôt tell you and hide it from you. - see this¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3zbzRvaC_Q\n- at the same time it is imp to tell her we don‚Äôt take things that belong to others. You can give an example of how would she feel if someone took something that belonged to her. You can say this without making her feel that she is a thief. Because she is just excited by seeing the pencils and erasers. - each parent can have different ways to share what they feel is right with the child but the most important bit is to talk to the child with love and care. - Finally you could set a pocket money say 500 rs for month and say this is yours, you save 100 rs in the bank and spend 400 on whatever you want.

Earlier he would eat, and be interested .. now he just does not take a bite of anything.

   "completion": "Throwing is normal for kids - he is just trying to understand gravity and develop his finger grip. Just create a bucket of things he can throw. That works best. But this is the need of the childOn food you have to trust that we are animals and when we are hungry we will eat. It is great you don't use screen. Involve him in meal preparation if you can or grandmother can, small tasks. Plus dont expect him to sit and eat. he can be moving and eating and can take his time. Also fruits can be kept at his eye level so that when he is hungry he can pick during the day. On your first one don't doubt your need. Separation anxiety is real. Spend time with the child where you are completely with him no phone, because you have in laws it seems like you are able to work easily, which is great. You can go outdoors, you can do a trip together, whatever helps both of you feel connected. The key is not to be anxious :-) He is lucky to have the love of both his mother and grandmother"

She will find her way. If you are anxious that can pass on the same way as happiness can pass on. you made good friends later, she will also make friends when she is ready\n\n\nif there are learnings and experiences from your childhood you can always share that with her.

Your daughters could get a chance to come home and play with the opposite sex. And that's ok too. Personally I would prefer my daughter to go to a school where both boys and girls go. Because she can then learn and interact with both. Hope this helps"

   "prompt": "Hi, your content is very helpful and the story you recently shared on insta on mud getting struck in girls hair is very enlightening. Please do share tips on how to discourage thumb sucking. My kid is 18 months and thumb sucking has increased crazily after stopping breastfeeding. He is hurting his thumb because of this.",
   "completion": "Akhila, here's my view. Thumb sucking is a way for your child to feel secure. Earlier breastfeeding gave him that feeling, now thumb sucking is giving him that feeling. My understanding is that this is only a problem is it continues beyond the age of 5 when permanent teeth are coming. Till then what you can do is two things- you can see when does the child do this, is it in a particular setting or environment, for e.g. when you are about to leave or at a particular time of the day. Essentially observe over react.Honestly you can absolutely ignore it, chill :-), let him be soothed. Maximum you can smile at your child, touch the child and gently remove the thumb. So now the child is being soothed by your presence. Hope this helps.LikeForwardCopyUnsendPlease do let me know what happens"

   "completion": "Can you tell me a little more about your kid. What does hyperactive mean? What kind of speech delay?How old is he?How much time does he watch cartoon?\n\n\n‚Äî\nOne imp bit here is that some children do need help. If you think that is the case and you are feeling anxious about it - take the help of a speech therapist. Go for one session and see how you feel with what they say. Overall you have now started on the right path so don't worry. don't be anxious :-) the children can sense it and then feel there is something wrong in them but they are only the product of the environment that we made for them. Most speech delays happens because the child is not getting enough practice to speak. The child learns language through practice and that is missing. Practice is generally missing because of two main reasons. First is high cartoon time. I have now spoken to, chatted with multiple parents who wrote about speech delay for their child and in 80% cases the reason seems to be 2-3 hours of cartoon time a day.The second biggest reason practise is missing is that the parents are busy and we are not talking to our child enough. Not smiling, looking into the eyes and engaging with the child. This is leading to delay in speech.So- stop cartoon time- talk to him more often, hug him more- take him outdoors to play. And I think in 2 months you could see wonderful results.. Go in nature as much as you can, stop timezone, malls etc. Does that make sense?"

If you know then you will know what to look for when you visit the school\n- if you have read you will also be in a position to ask the school the right questions\nThe key thing is not the studies at that age but does the school staff understand children and why children behave the way they do.

   "completion": "Hetal ji, the problem here is 'what does it mean for a child to do well'. Does well mean having the confidence to follow one's own path, does well mean feeling emotionally safe and secure, does well mean becoming a CEO of a company or being in a highly paid job even if you know I don't love doing it.So the question really is what does 'well' mean for the parentLikeForwardCopyUnsendFor me 'well' means- having the confidence to pursue your choices. Not getting bogged down by what society feels or wants you to do.- being resilient in doing what you are doing, not giving up easily- having a kind heart, learning to live with all kinds of people who look, feel different than us- being healthy - being able to understand their own body, food, need for exerciseThat's my personal choice :-), you have to make yours"

But these little little things he needs to be called out for so many times, which make me lose patience and i have tried not to asking it for a whole day just to see when he feels it's time to brush but it takes him hours to realise and then he does that...what should I do?",
   "completion": "Hitanshi, all of us crave sense of agency which is feeling of control over actions and their consequencesBut if it has been taken away it can take time to come back. How is it taken away? By too much talking, too many reminders, too much pushing around to do what the adult wants the child to doHow can it be brought back? By giving freedom but by setting the right environment.So what is the right environment?To create the right environment what you need to do is sit down with him, hug him, tell him we love you so much. And I think you can do things yourself and I don't want to follow up with you. So let's together make rules of the house. These rules have to be made together and have to be simple. For e.g. coming home for dinner at 7, TV time of 30 min, brushing and bathing, leaving for school at X time.And they have to be done with him, like you could write them together. This can only happen well when you do it with lot of love and care but firmness.And then you can support him - by waking him up once. It is possible he might miss school a few days, a week. The rule then is that at home there can not be any TV, he can play by himself so that others can do their own work.But finally his sense of agency should return.You could think about why is brushing so imp to you, let him feel how it feels to not brush for 7 days. Let's see what happens? The only thing you need to do is tell him lovingly that iske baad waapis daant nahin aayenge agar kharaab ho gaye to.I hope this helpsplease do tell me what happensLikeForwardCopyUnsendfeel free to ask"

Along with that walking into the environment had a positive feeling with the way it was laid out. It was bright, clean, big windows with light streaming in. So both of them combined. If you read a bit on Montessori then you will be able to understand better. For e.g. you could pick one of the following books Montessori method (first two chapters are hard), Discovery of childhood or Secret of childhood - read chapter 4 and 5.

I'm texting you personally as we're in a situation which is quite confusing for us as parents.Our son is 4 yrs 10 months old. He will complete 5 years on 15th April. Recently he just completed his class Nursery (also known as LKG in some schools) and has been promoted to UKG. The confusion is right at this point you see.He studied LKG in a pre-primary school. And now we are shifting him to a bigger school where he can study till his 12th. The thing is, the bigger school did not let us admit him into UKG so we enrolled him in LKG once again. We made up our minds that our son will be 7 years when he reached Class 1.But yesterday's final PTM in his nursery school changed everything. They didn't use to have exams. Children were evaluated on a weekly basis observing their daily progress in class. His report card says that he writes well, and his oral needs practice.His teacher too appreciated about his progress. While speaking to a few other parents, we got to know that many of the children have been enrolled into UKG as per the age.At this point, we felt bad as it seems now that we are pulling our child backwards by making him repeat the same year again, just different school.Can you please advise me as to what should we do?

For e.g. think when your child is 40 years old, will it matter whether he is in UKG or LKG?During Covid, my daughter said I don't want to do online class, so we said ok. So she didn't go to school for an year. And now all her friends are one class ahead. But she doesn't care and neither do well. But you could also talk to the teacher and say you want to shift his class to one ahead. That is ok too :-)The key part is: how is the school teaching, is your child learning joyfully, does he have enough time to play outdoors, to follow his sense of agency. Rest which standard does not matter :-)"

My 1yr old baby is becoming more n more stubborn for small things Like if I don't give her what she want she hit her head or just slap herself on head .Screaming too much not eating properly throwing things if I told her \"don't put in mouth\" .How to handle this?

To be joyful with your child.Kids put things in their mouth because that his how they learn about the worldit's ok to do that as long as there is no choking risklet him please do itAnd given now she has some tantrums, don't give into tantrums. It is possible you are stopping the baby too much. Sit back, relax, observe your child with neutral eyes. Don't interfere too much :-)"

My husband doesn't have any role to play actually he is a quiet person n he loves my daughter a lot n arhan my boy use to trouble her a lot siblings riverly is at peak for us so mu husband takes sarinas stand n shout at him so I guess he doesn't have a very lovable bond i guess",

So your husband can take him to playground or you could say let us play something- involving him in helping with your daughterwhat he wants is to know that he is loved by his parentsIf I was in your place I would talk to him and ask why he does not like Arabi classAnd if seems really insistent on not going, I would stop it. I will say, I love you and it is ok if you don't want to goBut that depends on why he does not want to go - it is possible it is because he feels pushed to go, it could be because teacher is not good, it could be because he sleeps late at night and feels tired in the morning, it could be because he feels mom dad want to send him outside of the house so that they can spend time with sister. A child's mind is very simple. So you can understand this. The key part is your child doesn't need your 'talks', he needs your love and hug, and warmth"

The clear way to address this is to just calmly say no. Give him a hug, love and say no firmly but calmly. If you get agitated and the child is able to get a reaction out of you, he will continue. And you don't need to call him naughty. If you keep calling him that, he will believe it and he will become one.

   "prompt": "Hello sirI was going through your content and its amazing.I could actually relate every ounce of it.I have a question for you..What about childhood traumas they get when they see there parents fighting with eachother constantly?We talk about upbringing by providing everything a child wants... But what about good parenting?Because a person gets love and affection from their parents. But when you see your own parents fighting with eachother... I feel its mentally very disturbing.\n\nIn this case, what do you think a child should do?How they should handle it?\nOne is 18yrs and the other is 7yrs",
   "completion": "Hi Khushi, the idea is not to 'provide everything the child wants'. The idea is to provide child with a loving environment so that the child can feel safe and cared for. That does not mean listening to all their wishes or agreeing with him. It just means being with them with love. Seeing parents fight can be traumatic for children. It can make them feel unsafe. It can make them feel it is because of them. It can have an impact on development of both EQ and IQ in the child.\n\nHow old is the child?\n\nThe 7 year old can't do much. The 18 year old should know that this is not because of them. She can have a conversation with her parents that what you are doing has an impact on me and the young kid in the hope that they can understand. Rest she also can't do more. Except may be think of going to hostel for college!"

He is about to start with his nursery session but hardly wants to practice abc or sit.If I tell him let‚Äôs learn sleeping line,standing line he starts saying arey‚Ä¶.no, I am katti.I don‚Äôt want to talk to u.Everyday is getting tougher as he does not wish to sit n learn.He just wants screen time but does not want to make a habit to revise or study.\nWhat should I do?Hope ur suggestions will help me resolve the issue:)\n\nHarpreet my kids can have screen time full time(unlimited hours) till the time i don‚Äôt pull off the internet wire.They dont have anywhere to go as I reside in delhi n that too not in a very safe area.\n\nHe started goin to play school in July n this behaviour has started like 2 weeks back(May b coz of YouTube videos they both watch together)\nWe r a nuclear family of 4.to get my work done or completed I get busy n allow them to see the screen so that they allow the help to do the work.Otherwise they keep moving creating mess even when the house is getting broomed.\n\nMy kids have been keeping unwell since Oct.I was always busy with my daughter 8+ to make her a topper n neglected him totally thinking he will learn from school n the effort from my side has been like 10%.So all he did is play,play n play.\n\nMy husband hardly gives time to kids.He is always busy with his office.He comes home by 8-9 n then gets busy with news or Netflix\nAll we visit is mall on Saturdays or some frens for lunch or gurdwara at times but nothing major for kids.",
   "completion": "How much screen time does he get?And when did his katti behaviour start?how much free time does he get to play? what is his daily schedule like?LikeForwardCopyUnsenddo you or your husband get time with your older kid one on one daily?\n\nYour son is young. Young children 'can't sitThey are designed to not sit coz the brain learns through movement. Please do understand this. If you make him sit, learning will stop not increase. He has the desire of evolution to move.- you want to do your job- you want a clean house- you want kids to sit- in the family (your husband) you don't have time for kidsIt might sound harsh but in that case why have kids?I don't mean to say this rudely at all. But as a means for you to introspect.The issue is not with your son. The mindset change required is for you and your husband. So my question to you is: can you do the mindset change? Can you let your kids be? Not worry about a clean house? Can you take out at least 30 min for them everyday with lot of love? Can you take them out to nature? And most importantly can you not use mobile as a nanny. Your children if they continue to see mobile won't develop empathy. Their minds will be hooked to dopamine, they won't develop the concentration to study. This is a big price to pay for a clean house.I am not sure if I answered your question or raised more questions.

One of your post says parenting is interfering.I agree, and i want my child to be on his own, especially play on his own.But he doesn't play anything/most of the things, until i join him, that's my struggle with him. He is 3.5yrs old. Example- jigsaw puzzle, wooden rainbow stackers, anything he pulls out to play, he insists that he wants to play with me. Often he will take out toys, not play with it, take out next in next couple of minutes and when I ask him why he didn't play with the first one, he says, i was waiting for u to join, u didn't come, so i didn't play that.... he goes to a proper montessori school, so any tips or suggestions?",
   "completion": "Hi Aastha, my daughter was like this for the longest time.If I was in your place, I would- not ask this question why didn't you play.- be ok if the child is not playing with any toy- make my house more lively, say a swing, a hanging bar, some mud, some live creature- I will give my child time with me morning and evening and afternoon. So that the child knows that he will get my time. So that he feels connected.The more connected he feels to you, the more independent he will become. This is imp to understand. The safer he feels the more independent he becomes. So the path to him being more free is through your unconditional love.. Also having another kid from neighbourhood will also help"

I being the only woman in the house was expected to do everything; chores of the house, take care of my daughter who was 1 year old then. The men were my husband , my brother in law and my father in law. All busy with their lives and I was busy with everything around. My daughter needed me but I was in a space where I was expected to match my mother in law and hence began her screen time to such an extent that she developed virtual autism and a speech delay. 1 year later now after therapies and early intervention she seems like a normal toddler, but there are still things that trouble me... if there is any guidance that I can get. She starts her preschool in June as per her age.

How she can learn from those slips is what matters, and how when one loses - say in a race, you can end up actually winning and discovering a lot more within!\nI know some kids, who are not able to digest their loss (not judging, just an observation). Loss of any kind- losing a friend, losing a game of tennis or a relay race; they tend to howl, hit, be aggressive as an expression of not being ok with the loss.

Due to covid/lockdown situations, my kid couldn't attend a physical school at an earlier age and was directly admitted to this grade. He is almost done with Nursery, but we are still getting complaints from school about him being distracted and lately also misbehaving with other kids in school. He is improving academically. He is a happy kid, and he never cried about going to school, infact he loves going to school, but he ends up in situations where he is hitting or grabbing or smothering other kids. Not always with an intention to hurt them but is seldom understood by teachers or other kids. He has also been a very energetic kid and gets too excited about things and thus ends up behaving roughly. How can we as parents help him express himself in a better way?\nPS: I love all your videos, and i think you are doing a great job understanding the behavior of kids at a very core level.\nThanks üòä\n\nHe is not very interested in screens. He has never been, and no continuous use. He may play games on the phone for 10-15 mins n then run around. He will ask to turn on TV but not sit and watch. He would run n play n may be some particular poem catches his attention and he will watch for a few minutes and then again he would run n play.Outdoor time, he is in day boarding school and has free play time at least 1 hr in school and on most days he gets an hour of Outdoor time at home also. At home, if he wants something that is not ok ,we talk to him, and he is not a stubborn kid. He understands. And even if it is something he really wants and we have a discussion about it and if it is not too harmful we sometimes agree and if it is not we distract him and give him to get over it.LikeForwardCopyReportHe doesn't create a lot of hue and cry for anything. But he loves rough-housing. With his grandpa, he would climb on him like a monkey.\n\nHis school timings are 8 am to 3 pm. In this time they get an hours time for napping.

A child‚Äôs brain‚Äôs key job is to make the child feel secure. When you say to the child I will go, the brain starts to focus on survival and hence can‚Äôt grow in higher order like learning. It‚Äôs like when our mind is not calm, then we find it difficult to work. In children it is amplified. But here‚Äôs what you can do now: you have to catch hold of your daughter and tell her listen. I told you I will go away only to get you to eat food. It was foolish of me to say that. I want you to know that I love you and no matter what happens I will ALWAYS ALWAYS be there for you‚ù§Ô∏èThat is what her brain needs to hear till she is comfortable again. Hope this help.\n\nPlease do consider that we are animals. So each one of us know how much we want to eat. The parent of the child doesn‚Äôt know. We have to trust the child with their food choices (apart from junk)"

   "prompt": "Gmrng. I hope you are well, Sir. A small update on how things r moving.We have got to better terms of communication not much much but say like 50%.. She still gets emotionally overwhelmed quite easily, where it's only me who can calm her down so m working on myself too to not get too angry or upset on her....I try telling her crying and repeatedly doing things not needed like shouting will not work instead to calmly talk it out and tell me what she wants and then listen to me and we will reach out in between.I've been down with low bp for the last week, so she's been taking more care and talking to me like she's my mom instead of the other way round...Proactively m talking to her more positively espc mornings when she's up and ready for school and at night before sleep, we talk abt things that she wants to do it her vacations ...she's eating better and listens and understands y I want her to eat healthy and get stronger....She's starred to use my exact words and statements nowadays.. same lines she's using on me , my family members.. so I have to ensure I don't use negative words or words that she should not hear atleast till the time she is not supposed to..I also want to on a very serious note tell u that I do appreciate all the hard work u do to make things easier for ppl like me who r struggling being single parents or not... cos she has me to look up to only and not the other parent that wud teach her other imp things in life.. who shud have been there .. and not ran away from responsibility with excuses alone. Thank you is a small word but it defines how much it can make a difference to one saying it.God bless you and someday I wud like to know and hear more abt your daughter too. I know cos I had seen one of ur videos where u had mentioned abt how children do things they are scared of very easily when they see their own friends do it that encourages themselves to do it too..have a gr8 day.Sir, one small advise if u can pls help me with... I have to tell her 1 thing a minimum 10 times to make her do it... like pls eat food , don't sit with it for an hour... lets get some rest for like an hour , pick up your toys and keep them back.. unless told her repeatedly she does not do it...M still struggling on this ... my patience bar has gone so high that I sometimes end up giving up on it .. üòíüòí",

Both of you can sit together and make rules of the house together, simple ones. You can do it while you are out driving a car or in auto or whenever both of you feel connected to each other. Don't worry so much for your child, get rest, eat food. She's ok. Just ensure there is not more than 30 min of screen time and the rest will fall into place. Again you can make rules and hold her, hug her and say I am going to stop repeating things. And mumma needs your help in the house, make food together, let her do dusting. Kids can enjoy when given simple responsibilities"

I‚Äôve been following you only recently and a smile spreads across my face everyone I see you support/ guide parents who are concerned about mobile usage.‚ù§Ô∏è\nReplied to your storyThis is because I live close to my parents, and am a working mother so I haven‚Äôt had much say in terms of my children‚Äôs screen time until a few months ago. Last August my parents were out of town so I took a chance and told my kids that this special Mother sons time (nearly 10 days) would be spent without the TV. I was met with a TON of resistance naturally.\nReplied to your storyAs my children(they were 4yrs old twins then) were always fed with a TV in front of them for the last 2 yrs. I would sit with them when they cried and hold them but would say that I can‚Äôt allow it because it is not okay to watch for that long. I sometimes even lied (when I had no bandwidth to explain to them during my solo parenting stint) that the TV was spoilt. It has now been 8 months. Of No TV while eating. They get about 20-30 min of tv at my uncles place which I agreed to. But that‚Äôs it.‚ù§Ô∏è\nReplied to your storyThe MAJOR benefits that we have reaped as a family include them playing far more, them having a little quiet time and focus while doing any activities at home, they are now on the way to self feeding since the last 2 months, they tell me when they‚Äôre hungry (before I wouldn‚Äôt know if they were hungry or wanted to watch TV). There‚Äôs now a lot more imaginative play and a lot more story telling. And many more subtle priceless changes in behaviour.LikeReport\nReplied to your storyThe work you‚Äôre doing is massive when you support parents to choose differently.

   "prompt": "Hi Harpreet, saw few of your videos and decided to message. I moved to Uk with my husband nearly 6-7 months back and brought along my son who had just turned 1 year old. During the first 42 days we lived in a company provided accommodation, he used to enjoy with Naani (my mom was here for 5 months) and then we shifted to another house, the house had separate floors. His screen time increased significantly sometimes even 6-7 hours In day as my husband behaved like an absent parent. Managing home, meals, new job and kid got a little difficult in the new country, I was stressed some of the times. So we stayed in uk for 5 months and then went to India for a month and realised my son is not responding like 18months old. He does not point, I never taught him pointing to be honest. is going to be 20 months tomorrow and still does not respond to his name. He loves playing, running around, responds to rhymes and songs that I sing. Loves being tickled, likes climbing on sofa and bed and stairs.He hasn‚Äôt been around any kids for the last 7 months. And his language and speech is not the same as other toddlers his age.I didn‚Äôt notice not pointing, not responding to name earlier because I thought he was distracted by tv. He eats his food himself breaking pieces, he normally does exploring the place himself so I never thought to teaching him aloud things like ‚Äúgive‚Äù or ‚Äútake‚Äù or go. He is very careful about his safety and would find ways to walk safely, crawls if he thinks the floor is very uneven, changes way of walking if he sees he might fall. He is definitely aware of his surroundings. He likes to be around males more and has no problem making eye contact with most of the people. He is shy around femalesI am worried about a few things:1. He is not responding to name2. Not pointing out himself (does give other cues and grunts if he wants things and sees I have them)3. Does not imitate enough4. I have not given him screen time mostly after 10th Feb and see changed in his eye contact, his eye contact is definitely improving but does not respond if called. Could you please help with some directions üôè",
   "completion": "Preeti ji, you seem to have a wonderful child who loves playing, running around‚ù§Ô∏èScreen time can have a devastating affect on the child's brain but below the age of 2 years most of it is recoverable.So stop stressing, give him as much love and hugs as you can. And engage with him, get him company of kids. Observe hiim, notice him without interfering.Also I am not a physician or a doctor. So if something is really worrying you please go for a visit to a paediatrician. But overall stop worrying, start spending carefree loving time with your son, involve him in house activities a bit and see him blossom! You did a great job by stopping screen. Kudos"

I have gone through this recently to an extent that I was anxious about my child all the time, eventually landing up with health issues myself. She is just 6 years old. Earlier a very extrovert and outspoken personality and now strong willed, spontaneous but like to spend time with herself. First time we got worried about her was when we saw her picnic pictures in which she wasnt smiling and sat away from all. She is a deep observer and likes to go slow but it pained our heart when we saw her interest losing away from school because she probably felt hurt due to some kind of peer pressure I believe.

Rather than be pressurised to do things.When he is 40 years old this 1 year that you are worrying about won't matter at all :-)‚ù§Ô∏èso don't worryyou love your son, that is so apprant. and that is the thing that child needs the most.

   "prompt": "My 4year daughter is not able to identify colour. Even after telling 10 times it is yellow colour she would say orange colour. What should I do",
   "completion": "Hi Chhaya, First of all don't worry :-)You don't need to ask her 10 times. She need not feel that because she sees the world differently than you, she is lesser than othersAll of us see the world differentlyIt is possible that she is colour vision deficient. And that's ok.You can do the below test. Please read and see---To give yourself a basic indication of whether there might be a problem with your child‚Äôs colour vision, get a sheet of white paper and a basic set of colouring pencils ‚Äì at least 12 different colours but including green, red, brown, orange, blue, purple and grey. Use mid-range shades, not too pale or too dark‚Äì and shade an area of about 2cm by 2cm of each colour onto the paper. Make sure that the colours are in random order and that you don‚Äôt have all the reds or greens together, but do place red, green and brown adjacent to each other. Take the paper and your child to an area with good natural light (but not a bright light, artificial light or strong sunlight) and make up a fun game which involves asking your child to identify all of the colours on the sheet. Do not show them each colour individually, they must be able to see all of the colours at the same time.If your child shows signs that they are not sure whether a colour is red, green, brown, purple, blue or grey, there is a reasonable chance that they are red/green colour blind. Before you start ask them which colours are the easiest for them to identify. You should expect a red/green colour-blind child to be able to identify bright blue and yellow (they can identify these colours by brightness and shade). Make sure you include these colours so that they do not get the impression that they aren‚Äôt clever enough for the game. Just do this once with love. And share back. Again don't make your child feel that just because she sees the world differently something is wrong with her!"

   "prompt": "Plz make any video for thumb sucking",
   "completion": "Hi Vrinda, will do. But here are my thoughts- The idea is that your child has a brain pattern set for soothing. Earlier breastfeeding gave the child that feeling, now thumb sucking is giving the child that feeling. As the teeth become sharp the child will find alternate ways. So it is only a problem if it continues beyond the age of 5 when permanent teeth are coming. Till then what you can do is two things.- Firstly you can see when the child does this, is it in a particular setting or environment, for e.g. when you are about to leave or at a particular time of the day. Essentially observe over reacting to the situation.- And if you want to you can smile at your child, touch the child, and gently remove the thumb. So now the child is being soothed by your presence.- If I was you, I would ignore it, and let the child be soothed."

That is step one. Once she feels secure she will leave you.

The child had no such need. This idea of comparison is dangerous in the long run. Because comparison can easily become the root cause of stress, anxiety in life.

So what can we do now.- He is 4. you can hold him, hug him and tell him listen it is imp for you to know that coming first is not imp, it is imp that you gave your best. Coming first does not matter to us.- is there any need to celebrate at all? there is no need, what you can do is hug him irrespective of what position he gets- if he throws a tantrum when he loses, don't react with oo dont cry etc. Just be there for him, again hug helps, holding hands help. Asking did you try your best helps. They will easily stop if you don't react to them- Finally you could find some books which you can read to him around this. I will try to search and share- First is not to react to the tantrum- stay calm, chill and move forward.

Before I had many goals but after becoming parent I don't know why I just don't want to get out of house leaving my children. I just want to parent them myself as long as I can .My parents said we will look after ur children u go and earn money so that they canHave a good life without any financial problems.My husband also asking me to look for a job as it can help him financially. I said him that iam not interested in doing job leaving my children. He said ur parents will look after them. So u need not to worry about them. But still Iam not ready to leave them and go for work. My parents are not ready to receive the new parenting strategies we came to know now like understanding ur child and their emotions etc. When I tell them that we have to deal children calmly like this when they don't feel good . My parents just don't want to listen and they will scold and shout at my children sometimes when they don't stop crying my parents shout loudly. This is the reason I just want to parent my children as no one in my family accepts my way of parenting and pressuring me to go for work even after talking multiple times. So is there any guidance I can have from you regarding this. I do want to help my family financially but iam not ready to leave my children at home.I just want to be available for them all the time as long as I can. And also I want to earn money but not by leaving my children and go out for work what should I do. My main pressure is my husband and I had a 17 yr age gap so by the time my children turns 20 he will be 60. So my family is pressuring me even more regarding this. My husband has a huge credit card debt from past 5 years also had a heart stroke once. So he always has a fear that if he will die suddenly how can I look after my children without job.Even after all these reasons I still just not ready to leave my children I just want to see them grow and be a part of their life by following gentle concious parenting approach.

Please suggest me something so that I can have a clear viewBecause of my parents pressure I joined online coaching for govt job but iam not at all interested.

   "completion": "It is both ok and not ok to send :-)The same way it is ok and not ok for the child to be at homeWhat I mean is that a child needs varied experiences. As long as the home and outdoors have it, that is great. Children learn through movement, as long as they can do that and there is the world to explore, other kids to meet house is fine.If you don't have time, or if the child is at home alone and it's an apartment, sending to a day care is fine too. The key is - the day care should let the child be - the child should not be asked to sit at a place and learnLikeForwardCopyUnsendhttps://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17998361383653389/you can see these"

   "completion": "Hi Dr Pratisha, our children crying can affect us a lot. That's normal. But kids biting is normal behaviour as they don't know how to control their emotion. Can happen to anyone. So that's ok. To make him strong, he needs love. The more stable his relationship with you is the better is able to face the world. And you have a lot of time to make it happen. How you have described it already looks like he feels secure so that's great.\n\n\nOverprotection can lead to that. But from what you have told me you don't seem to be doing that. We don't need to rush to protect our children. It is imp to believe that children can take care of themselves and that it is ok to fall and learn.

We had a nanny - 21 Yrs (Rohini) with whom our daughter enjoyed a lot, playing, signing, dancing etc. The nanny (Rohini) was also good and she played with her nicely\n2. Unfortunately, she ended up leaving because of her personal problems & there was no clear closure for my daughter. The nanny was a live-in nanny.\n3. Even today my daughter recalls the songs that they sang together, cherishes the games they played and remembers her at-least 6-7 times a day\n4. We have replaced her with a nanny, who is much more good but aged around 35 Yrs. But this nanny is a day nanny, comes at 10 and leaves at 7. Its more than 1.5 months and my daughter has not adjusted to the new nanny. She gets irritated and reluctant to play or move with her. She has become clingy to me and my wife.\n5. I am clueless, what to do? Can you please help us out.\nIn case, if you can be reached out through phone and provide a consultancy that would be great. Will wait for your reply.",
   "completion": "Hi PreethamI don't do consultations personallybut if you can share which city you are in, I can share some counsellors who might be able to helpin my view: there was a change - the child will take time to adjust - we have to give the child that time. What the child wants till then is security - which she is getting from you and your wife. The more you offer that, the more secure she will feel which is what is imp for her well beingA young child becoming clingy to her parents is normal, isn't it?A parent not being ok with it and wanting their child to be clingy to someone else, that though has become popular, isn't normal. Isn't it?LikeForwardCopyUnsendMy personal view is you should be happy your nanny went away.

   "completion": "Hi Raman, thank you for your wonderful messageI think your child has found a love. And you should nurture his loveHe is young so nurturing means allowing him to play. Not buying new cars, new toys all the time. But allowing him to play with whatever he chooses to with. You can go in multiple directions. You can get him actual car parts, bike parts to play with, you can take him to musems which talk about transportation. You can get him to sit in a road roller, you can take his help to change tyre of the car or scooter. He can get real tools like a mechanic. You can use cardboard and make a toy car with him, you can see if likes seeing F1 race or go carting tracks. There are lot of ways to nurture his love. It is through this sense of agency that he will develop concentration that will be useful for everything he does in life. And he might not learn to write cat first but will learn to write tractor, aeroplane all because he loves cars. You can use it for teaching almost anything.LikeForwardCopyUnsendI hope this helps"

Later within 15 min i will be dying with mom guilt.

Hope you forgive me.Then she says ok amma,i love you amma.But I'm not sure whether she is really forgetting about that,forgiving me for real or thinking i apologise and repeat again.I'm very much worried. She is not at all expressive child. Apart from me she don't share her feeling with her father also. She diverts if he asks anything. In very rare scenarios she shares with him.

For now for next one month you could may be do 15 min of cartoon morning, afternoon, evening to feed. and then stop that also slowly- start talking to her please with love. this helps her practise.- take her outdoors, give her space to play in nature.

A child throws things because they have just discovered gravity, not because they want to upset mother so we can make a bucket of things to throws. She wants to play with water, let her- take her outdoors and let her beIf you can step back and observe, then this will be a boon for your child and you will also change as a person and have less stress :-)Wishing you the very best"

That she knows she can do what she wants to do. But she is not a kid kid now, so if you start doing it today, it might take 1 day or a few months to emergefor e.g. which classes does she go to, does she choose herself or are they chosen for her? Essentially if you can give her time and space, she will emerge. She might still be the same in that case you can be more chill :-)Hope this helps"

We have in the past seen her enjoy water, in a natural stream and at home. However, at the camp with new people and at the pool, she has been reluctant to step into the water or follow the coach. She cries for the entire 1 hour that she is there. I have to be by her side constantly and negotiate. She screams and cries that she is afraid. Its been a week now since she joined. While we are not comparing how other children have progressed. We just don't know how to make her feel comfortable. We don't want to give up. Perhaps its more about our ambition than hers.\nI heard from other parents in my peer that they have faced similar situations of dislike with their children when they were sent to classes for the activities those kids generally liked and were good at.\nDo you have any insights on that?\n\nThank you for taking time to respond!EnterJyoti NairI will do the needful :)\n\nHi, I thought you may like to know this update.\nTaking your advice we enrolled her out of the camp.

   "prompt": "Harpreet, today, my concern is that I have a daughter of 3.5 years, and she used to be friends (like best of friends) with a girl who lives nearby. They used to play happily whenever we were in the garden. \n\nNow the other girl has completely stopped playing with her altogether, and it pains me a lot when I see my daughter sulk at the reaction and not receive the same kind of excitement or bonding from her.\n\nI am not sure how to make her understand that it's okay. One should move on or if I really should meddle in her affairs and let her know so as not to play with her?Enter\nAkanksha MittalA guidance from you on this would be highly appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance,\nAkanksha",
   "completion": "This is a chance for her to understand her own emotions. Just be around with love. The phase will pass. It can be hard for mothers but this is building in her what is required and it will be helpful when she grows up"

   "prompt": "Hi Harpreet,\nHope you are doing well!\nI'm a big fan of your podcast and keep re-listening to it for different perspectives and endorse it within my circle of friends. I firmly believe parenting is subject of continuous learning and advocate it as much as I can! Thank you for what you do - you are truly creating an impact!\nWas a bit curious [staying true to the podcast ;) ], your last episode came out in April, more episodes en route? If yes, hope you don't mind me taking the liberty of suggesting a topic - would love an episode / hear your thoughts on gentle parenting.\nOnce again, thank you for all you do & keep helping us parents with your learnings & nuggets of knowledge :)\nPS: If you plan to do a meetup / host a VC, I would love to be a part of it!\nRegards,\nManu\n\n\nThank you for the response, Harpreet. I'm actually not on Insta though I'm upto speed with the shorts you upload on YouTube.\nPodcast ka maza thoda alag hai and hence asked :)\nYes, my wife & I are of the same opinion on firm parenting however, the fad these days & everyone around is into gentle parenting. Kids know they won't be \"bossed\" around and get away with whatever they do & want. Once they all grow up, while our kids are obedient and understand when said 'no' to, their peers may not necessarily. I often ponder on whether the obedient ones will get bullied by the other bunch while growing up & in the real world - given they are sort of given the freedom to act however they want without consequences\n\nThis makes a lot of sense, I'll keep in mind the 1% parenting. Also, I'm not quite able to understand the \"A child who can do whatever they want whenever they want is not equal to a confident child\" but that's food for thought for me - good topic to ponder & discuss on.\nThanks as always, Harpreet! Keep up the good work. If in future you need any help or I can contribute to the curious parent, please please do let me know :)",
   "completion": "‚Ä¢ Hi Manu\n‚Ä¢ Good to hear from you\n‚Ä¢ Yaar gentle parenting I haven‚Äôt studied. But I shall check\n‚Ä¢ I think it is imp to be firm\n‚Ä¢ Firm with love is the holy grail\nIf you are on Instagram take a look at the handle there\n\nI think there will be consequences. Just that the consequences are long term and more difficult to manage. For e.g. screen time leading to under developed brain. A child who can do whatever they want whenever they want is not equal to a confident child. Also firm with love parent does not mean an obedient child. If we are taking all decisions for kids then it could lead to a child who is meek. But if we are doing 1% parenting i.e. taking the most critical decisions, then the child should be able to preserve her/his sense of agency while understanding their place in the family."
